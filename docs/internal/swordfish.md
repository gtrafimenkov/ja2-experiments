# Swordfish

Full rewrite in Rust.

## Approach

- move the code to Rust function by function, structure by structure, until no C or C++ code left
- it is better to start with moving simple structures and stateless functions

## Inspiration

The project was inspired by Rust rewrite done by
[fish-shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9512).
